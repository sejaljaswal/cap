# UniPlay

UniPlay is a university sports networking platform aimed at helping students connect over their shared love for sports. It enables users to join sports clubs, create or participate in matches, and connect with fellow athletes across various sports disciplines — all within their university ecosystem.

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Problem Statement:**  
In many universities, students often struggle to find others who are interested in playing the same sport. Existing systems for organizing clubs or casual games are usually fragmented or offline. UniPlay aims to solve this by creating a centralized digital space where students can discover and join ongoing sports activities.

**Target Users:**  
- University students
- Sports club leaders
- Casual players looking for games

**Key Features (Planned):**
- 🔐 User authentication
- 🏏 Join or create sports clubs
- 📅 Match scheduling system
- 📢 Notification system
- 💬 In-app messaging
- 📊 Dashboard for player stats and participation
